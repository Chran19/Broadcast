# ✈️ Broadcast Receiver Demo

An Android application demonstrating the use of **BroadcastReceiver** to detect and respond to system-level events, specifically Airplane Mode state changes.

---

## 📖 Introduction

This project showcases how to implement a **BroadcastReceiver** in Android to listen for system broadcasts. The app monitors the device's Airplane Mode status and provides real-time visual feedback when the mode is toggled on or off.

BroadcastReceivers are a fundamental Android component that allows apps to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements, making them essential for building reactive applications.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Java
- **Min SDK:** 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Target SDK:** 35
- **Android Components:**
  - BroadcastReceiver
  - IntentFilter
  - Settings.Global
- **Libraries:**
  - AndroidX AppCompat
  - Material Design Components

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Registration:** The app dynamically registers an `IntentFilter` for `Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED` in `onStart()`
2. **Detection:** When Airplane Mode is toggled, the system broadcasts an intent
3. **Response:** The custom `AirplaneModeReceiver` receives the broadcast and updates the UI
4. **Cleanup:** The receiver is unregistered in `onStop()` to prevent memory leaks

### Key Code Snippet

```java
// Registering the BroadcastReceiver
IntentFilter filter = new IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_AIRPLANE_MODE_CHANGED);
registerReceiver(airplaneModeReceiver, filter);
```
